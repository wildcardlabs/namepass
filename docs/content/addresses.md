Retrieve the deposit address and supported funding networks for an ENS name.

## Request

```bash
curl -X POST '{{DOCS_ORIGIN}}/api/v1/address' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"name":"example.eth"}'
```

## Response

- `name`: the normalized ENS name.
- `depositAddress`: the payment address, shared across supported chains.
- `subname`: the corresponding `namepass.eth` subname.
- `subnameVerified`: whether the subname resolves to the deposit address on this deployment.
- `chains`: supported chain IDs, USDC token addresses and minimum funding amounts.

`subnameVerified: false` means resolution is unverified. Use the full `depositAddress` in that case.

The request activates deposit monitoring. Repeated requests for the same name return the same address. Use the returned chain configuration for funding.

## Send the payment

Transfer USDC to `depositAddress` on a returned chain. Use the subname only when `subnameVerified` is `true`. Save the transaction hash & source chain ID to [track the renewal](/docs/status).

## Errors

`422` indicates that the name cannot currently be renewed. `503` indicates that ENS data is unavailable; retry the address request before funding.
