# Testnet deployments

## Public design preview — 2026-10-05

`https://alpha.namepass.com` is the stable Preview domain for
`codex/homepage-docs-design` in the Vercel project `namepass-v2`. It follows successful
deployments from that branch. A failed build does not replace the last ready preview.
It does not follow other branches or the production branch `main`.

The domain has an `alias-protection-override` Deployment Protection Exception. External
visitors can open alpha without a Vercel account or a share-link token. The generated
deployment URL remains protected. The production domain `beta.namepass.com` is unchanged.

Alpha uses the [read-only branch preview proxy](FRONTEND.md#read-only-branch-previews).
Anonymous verification returned HTTP 200 for the homepage and populated activity,
HTTP 405 for activation writes, and HTTP 403 for the private monitoring route.

## Current release — 2026-09-22

The replacement contracts and hosted testnet services are deployed. The application uses the
addresses below. The September 22 cutover cleared the previous application's data; old deposit
addresses are not part of the current release.

| Contract | Address | Network |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Factory | `0x2dCB5CA6b21372b43e37C35Da8D5D15160423150` | All four testnets |
| Gateway | `0x39351C9f9eAb6093eFB4e865a6330ECd2a756F0f` | Ethereum Sepolia |
| Helper pointer | `0x774f942194d612e126A05Ce40a3A4D88AfBB6ae6` | Ethereum Sepolia |
| Initial helper | `0x7Bfee7c257ff48f8D787A61F15925e24743C8F88` | Ethereum Sepolia |
| Test timelock | `0x996cbd179f361B1043Ad1999864eD41496C633c8` | Ethereum Sepolia |

The test timelock is wallet-controlled with a 60-second delay. It is not the ENS DAO timelock.
The active helper can change through the pointer; read `currentHelper()` for live selection.

| Network | Chain ID | Factory deployment block |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Ethereum Sepolia | 11155111 | 11754050 |
| Base Sepolia | 84532 | 47132212 |
| Arbitrum Sepolia | 421614 | 311365500 |
| Arc Testnet | 5042002 | 63326249 |

Token addresses, Circle domains, RPC configuration names and explorer links are maintained in
[`src/lib/chains.ts`](../src/lib/chains.ts). Exact deployment parameters and hashes are in the
[manifest](deployments/2026-09-22/manifest.json).

## Verification evidence

| Record | What it establishes |
| --- | --- |
| [Deployment verification](deployments/2026-09-22/verification.json) | Replacement transaction receipts, runtime and configuration checks |
| [Source verification](deployments/2026-09-22/source-verification.json) | Published source and deployed bytecode matches |
| [Canary inputs](deployments/2026-09-22/canaries.json) and [verification](deployments/2026-09-22/canary-verification.json) | Direct Sepolia renewal and two native Arc deposit/claim rounds, including funding after wallet deployment |
| [Application preflight](deployments/2026-09-22/system-preflight.json) | Helper compatibility, address derivation and receipt enrichment |
| [Indexed cutover results](deployments/2026-09-22/system-cutover.json) | Three renewals projected into the replacement application |

These records are point-in-time evidence, not a security audit. A fresh automated deposit on
every source chain was not repeated after the reset. Older evidence must not be presented as a
new-generation live test.

## Resolver and mainnet limits

The replacement `namepass.eth` wildcard resolver is live, and its subnames appear in Name View.
This September 22 release record does not contain its mainnet deployment and parent-record
transaction receipts. The configured testing use case resolves to testnet deposit addresses even
though the parent ENS record is on Ethereum mainnet. That does not enable mainnet USDC funding or
mainnet renewal contracts.

No audited mainnet protocol release is recorded. Ethereum, Base, Arbitrum, and Arc are planned for
the initial mainnet release; none has a recorded Namepass mainnet deployment. Requirements are in
[RUNBOOK.md](RUNBOOK.md#mainnet-release-requirements).

## Integration release gate — 2026-09-30

The public API is not recorded as deployed. Migration `0009_public_status.sql`, the four `/api/v1`
endpoints and evidence Workflow are separate from the September 22 contract canaries. Keep
`NAMEPASS_INTEGRATIONS_ENABLED` disabled until the release has evidence for:

- Migration/backfill rehearsal on representative data, native identity preflight and disabling
  the feature without losing payment evidence.
- Anonymous address activation, block-pinned quotes, name history, transaction polling, platform
  abuse limits and hosted latency.
- Archive receipt and hub-finality provider support, plus a missed-start recovery drill.
- Signed direct and CCTP funding canaries that reach `complete` through the public polling route.
- Resolver/parent evidence and address equality before enabling the alias verification flag.

There are no partner credentials, outgoing webhooks or MCP release steps. Existing Goldsky
provider webhook configuration remains required for ingestion. Hosted changes, merge and wallet
signing retain their approval boundaries. Mainnet funding remains disabled. Local checks are
recorded in [integration validation](api/VALIDATION.md); operations are in
[the runbook](RUNBOOK.md#integration-api-operations).

## Historical evidence

The [September 18 manifest](deployments/2026-09-18/manifest.json) and accompanying receipts are
retained for contract provenance and test fixtures. That factory is superseded: it rejected native
Arc funding after wallet deployment. Its helper-replacement rehearsal and canaries apply to that
older generation. Do not derive current deposit addresses from it.
