# Architecture

Namepass combines permissionless renewal contracts with hosted indexing and execution.
Independent executors can use the contracts directly. Contract boundaries are described in
[CONTRACTS_V2.md](CONTRACTS_V2.md); deployed addresses and verification limits are in
[DEPLOYMENTS.md](DEPLOYMENTS.md).

## Contract route

An ENSIP-15-normalized label determines an ERC-1167 wallet through CREATE2. The factory address
and wallet bytecode are part of the derivation. Each deployment set uses the same factory on
all supported chains, so a label has one address but independent balances on each chain.

On the hub chain, the factory routes payment to the fixed gateway. On a source chain, it burns
USDC through Circle CCTP V2. The attested message mints on the hub through the gateway. The
gateway snapshots the helper selected by the timelock-governed pointer, authenticates payment,
and settles through that immutable ENS adapter. Mint and renewal succeed or revert together.
An independent executor can use these contracts without the hosted application.

## Service boundaries

| Component | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| `src/lib/chains.ts` | Shared chains, tokens, contract addresses and provider configuration names |
| Goldsky Turbo | Detect deposits and protocol events for watched wallets |
| Neon PostgreSQL | Canonical event projection, names, balance snapshots, flows and transaction intents |
| `routes/api/` and `server/` | HTTP validation, public reads, activation and authenticated operations |
| Vercel Workflow | Durable renewal execution, transaction confirmation and Circle attestation waits |
| `src/lib/publicApi.ts` | Browser access to application data |

Goldsky delivers events to the authenticated webhook. Native Arc transfers require transaction
value indexing; they need not emit ERC-20 Transfer logs. Gateway events supply renewal facts,
with receipt enrichment for ENS expiry. See [the pipeline reference](../goldsky/README.md).

## Names and balances

Activation normalizes a label, derives its wallet, reads ENS state and records block-pinned
balances. The watched-address table enables deposit detection. Failed scans remain recoverable.

Public balances start from a snapshot and apply canonical events after its block. Public
activity polling does not call chain RPC. Missing or inconsistent evidence is unavailable,
not zero. A flow amount is not another wallet balance. Arc's native and ERC-20 USDC views
represent the same funds and must not be added together.

## Flows and transactions

Eligible funds create a flow. Execution checks the name, submits the origin transaction, and
waits for its receipt. A cross-chain flow then waits for Circle's attestation and submits the
hub claim. Held, failed and unclaimed states preserve their reason and evidence.

An exact `DepositProcessed` event and Circle source nonce identify execution. Name, amount or
transaction hash alone cannot safely identify a flow. The final CCTP nonce comes from Circle
Iris; the origin MessageSent nonce is a placeholder. Unclaimed payments resume the same
message rather than burning again.

A durable transaction intent stores a business call before broadcast. A per-sender, per-chain
nonce queue serializes submissions. Same-nonce replacements preserve the business call. Any
stored attempt can mine, so confirmation checks all attempts. See [RUNBOOK.md](RUNBOOK.md) for
recovery procedures and [ENGINEERING_CONSTRAINTS.md](ENGINEERING_CONSTRAINTS.md) for invariants.

## Storage and reorgs

The schema is defined in `server/db/schema.ts`; migrations are in `drizzle/`.

- `names` and `goldsky.watched_addresses` identify tracked wallets.
- `chain_events` and `deposits` retain canonical evidence and deletion state.
- `balance_snapshots` and versioned `balance_scan_requests` support indexed balances.
- `flows` and `flow_transitions` record execution state.
- `transaction_intents` and `relayer_nonces` make broadcasts recoverable.

Canonical deletion removes an event's contribution. ENS expiry is recomputed from surviving
verified evidence. Locks serialize projections and balance recovery; a scan clears only the
request version it actually processed. Raw delivery payload retention is separate from normalized
facts. Unknown or malformed authenticated webhook rows are acknowledged with bounded diagnostic
evidence; authorization failures are rejected before body processing.

## Application and operations

The frontend displays public read models, exact prices and transaction evidence. On-chain flows
remain permissionless. Service health dashboards require GitHub authentication and add no scheduled
health RPC polling. They do not replace provider alerts. Recovery and retention jobs are documented in
[RUNBOOK.md](RUNBOOK.md); metric definitions are in [MONITORING.md](MONITORING.md).

## Planned public API

The public API backend has been removed. The published `/docs` guides and
`docs/api/openapi.json` describe the proposed interface, not deployed endpoint behavior.
The fresh implementation plan is [PUBLIC_API_PLAN.md](PUBLIC_API_PLAN.md).
Existing application routes, Goldsky ingestion and renewal Workflows remain the core backend.
The public API reset adds no database migration or hosted configuration change.

## Documentation and agent skill

`docs/content/` and OpenAPI generate the standalone `/docs` catalog in `shared/docs/`, plain
Markdown, `llms.txt`, `llms-full.txt` and the downloadable integration skill. Run
`npm run generate:docs` after editing inputs; CI checks freshness with `npm run check:docs`.
OpenAPI is a documentation input; it does not generate a server implementation or client types.
The short skill describes the proposed send-and-poll sequence. The API is unavailable until the
new implementation passes its release gates.
